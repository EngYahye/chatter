## Tutorial 04 - Migrate to Version 4 and Stream Firebase Extensions

This branch is the entry point to code along with tutorial 04. In this tutorial we migrate to version 4 of the [Stream Chat Flutter Core SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_chat_flutter_core). We also make use of the new [Stream Firebase Extensions](https://getstream.io/blog/stream-firebase-extensions/) to simplify authentication with Stream Chat and Firebase. Finally, we also clean up the code for future work.
